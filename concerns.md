# Questions

- What if component `HiddenFare` can publish `BetterPrice` message only after it receives two different messages, from two different components? Because it needs to calculate something based on those messages payload?

- How to horizontaly scale such services?

- What if I cannot get enough information from message payload and I have to read this information from (from what place?)?
